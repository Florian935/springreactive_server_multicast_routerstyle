# Spring Boot Reactive Project

This project is the server of this client: https://github.com/Florian935/springreactive_client_multicast_routerstyle

You can launch multiple instances of this client and connect to the server. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to multicast a stream of value from the server thanks to the share operator and the router / handler style code.
